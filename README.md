# Number_Guesser
This is my third coding project. I built a number guessing game that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player receives feedback ("higher" or "lower") after each guess until they find the correct number. The program tracks and displays the total number of guesses at the end. Created on 1/4/26 - 1/5/26.
